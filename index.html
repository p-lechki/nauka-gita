            <p>There's a shadow just behind me<br>
                Shrouding every breath I take<br>
                Making every promise empty<br>
                Pointing every finger at me<br>
                Waiting like a stalking butler<br>
                Who upon the finger rests<br>
                Murder now the path called must we<br>
                Just before the son has come<br>
                Jesus, won't you fucking whistle<br>
                Something but the past and done?<br>
                Jesus, won't you fucking whistle<br>
                Something but the past and done?<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Why can't we not be sober?<br>
                I just want to start this over<br>
                Why can't we drink forever<br>
                I just want to start this ove<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I am just a worthless liar<br>
                I am just an imbecile<br>
                I will only complicate you<br>
                Trust in me and fall as well<br>
                I will find a center in you<br>
                I will chew it up and leave<br>
                I will work to elevate you<br>
                Just enough to bring you down<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Mother Mary won't you whisper<br>
                Something but what's past and done<br>
                Mother Mary won't you whisper<br>
                Something but what's past and done<br>

                I just want to start this over<br>
                Why can't we sleep forever<br>
                I just want to start this over<br>
