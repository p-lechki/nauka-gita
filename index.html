            <p>There's a shadow just behind me
                Shrouding every breath I take
                Making every promise empty
                Pointing every finger at me
                Waiting like a stalking butler
                Who upon the finger rests
                Murder now the path called must we
                Just before the son has come
                Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
                Something but the past and done?
                Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
                Something but the past and done?
            </p>

            <p>
                Why can't we not be sober?
                I just want to start this over
                Why can't we drink forever
                I just want to start this ove
            </p>

            <p>
                I am just a worthless liar
                I am just an imbecile
                I will only complicate you
                Trust in me and fall as well
                I will find a center in you
                I will chew it up and leave
                I will work to elevate you
                Just enough to bring you down
            </p>

            <p>
                Mother Mary won't you whisper
                Something but what's past and done
                Mother Mary won't you whisper
                Something but what's past and done
            </p>

                Why can't we not be sober?
                I just want to start this over
                Why can't we sleep forever
                I just want to start this over
